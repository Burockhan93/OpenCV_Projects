## 🔷 3D Reconstruction

> Tools and algorithms for reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple images.  
As of now it includes techniques like depth estimation and point cloud generation.

> Following is the 3D Stereo estimation using OpenCV's Stereo SGBM. Dataset and camera calibrations used in this project can be found here [Backpack-perfect scene](https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2014/datasets/Backpack-perfect/)
